This repository contains a COBOL program with a bug related to date and time validation. The program is designed to accept date and time input from the user and validate if it is a valid date and time. However, it has limitations in handling dates beyond the year 9999 and does not perform robust time validation.  The `bug.cob` file contains the buggy code, and `bugSolution.cob` provides the corrected version.
